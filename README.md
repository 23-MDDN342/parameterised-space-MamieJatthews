### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 
Update this! 

For my concept I have decided to step in the direction of trippy looking loop animations. I want a fast paced and energetic looking animation that will be mesmorizing and seizure enducing at the same time. I am taking inspiration from starwars when they go into lightspeed because I like the quick flashing lines that speed towards you. I want to emulate going to lightspeed and then entering a time warp by having a transition between the flashing lines and a slower and warpy looking tube. 

Week 2:
Tuesday - I spent most of today just trying to understand the code from the example front scroll because my concept has a similar motion. I tried experimenting with values in the code to try and transform the lines as close as possible to a octasgon shape. In the end I decided to just use fresh code and design a hexagon using the beginShape(). I also translated the 0 point to the centre of the screen to make it easier for the shape to scale proportionaly. 

Week 3:
Tuesday - On tuesday I experimented with getting the octagon to move. Using Curfrac in the scale value I was able to get the octagon to zoom into the screen creating the motion I was looking for. However It still doesnt smoothly loop. I also messed around with the front scroll line template and shifted it around my scene to make a trippy background. 

Thursday - I successfully made a looping zoom with the octagon. I don't really know what I did but it managed to work and it looks awesome. 

Added a circle which using the same function as the octagon but is instead reversed so the scale goes from large to small. Trying to continue to make the scene look trippy
